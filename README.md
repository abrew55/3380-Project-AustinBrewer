Class project stuff 

For my application, I used Python 3 to develop a connection to my Major Leaugue Baseball Database. The package I used to develop the connection was the built 
in mysql.connector class that is optionally installed with MySQL. I built two functions that were in charge of collecting the names of every table and then
collecting all of the data from a desired table. The application itself was built off a package called tkinter, which itself is built into Python. My app works
by creating a popup window where the user can select a player/team with the desired type of data. This then will open another window displaying the desired 
stats. The user can simultaneously have as many tables open as they wish.

Upon submission time, I will have all of the necessary code complete with the 3NF requirements for the database. Between submission time and presentation time,
I will continue to populate the DB (I could have well over 600 tables if I chose) and I will probably throw together a powerpoint to highlight the goal and
the challenges I faced.
